# Module 3 — Replicable analysis

## 1. Why replicable analysis matters
- A data analysis should be understandable, reviewable, and redoable by anyone.  
- Replicability ensures that the reasoning behind the results is transparent, traceable, and scientifically trustworthy.

## 2. What makes an analysis replicable
Unlike a traditional analysis that only presents results and a short methodological summary, a replicable analysis explicitly records every step of the process: how data is obtained, how it is interpreted, how decisions are made, and how results are derived.  
Nothing should remain implicit or depend on memory ==> all steps must be documented.

## 3. Working with real-world data
- Real data always contains imperfections such as missing values, formatting inconsistencies, or ambiguities.  
- A key principle is to treat these issues openly and document how they are handled, rather than quietly correcting them or ignoring them.

## 4. Validating and understanding the data
- Before doing any analysis, it is essential to verify the correctness of the data and make sure it aligns with expectations.  
- This includes checking coherence, identifying anomalies, and making sure the structure of the data supports the questions being asked.

## 5. Asking and answering meaningful questions
A replicable analysis shows not just results, but how those results were reached from the raw data.  
Clear definitions, transparent transformations, and well-justified methodological choices are necessary to answer analytical questions reliably.

## 6. Interpreting outcomes with context
Even once results are obtained, they must be interpreted carefully.  
Patterns, trends, or summaries only make sense when connected back to the real-world context, the limitations of the data, and the decisions made during analysis.
